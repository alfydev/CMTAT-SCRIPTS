These are my scripts to deploy and interact with the CMTAT Ethereum token on Sepolia.

- In scripts/*.js the scripts require hardhat and the appropriate arguments must be defined as environment variables
- In scripts/standalone/*.js and scripts/gnosis/*.js they only require node, and the variables are defined as constants in the scripts themselves
